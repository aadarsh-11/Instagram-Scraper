# Instagram-Scraper
A simple tool to save all the images of an Instragram Handle

## How to use?

- Clone the repo and install dependencies by using this command in the terminal: 

      pip install -r requirments.txt


- Just run the [main.py](./main.py) file to run the program

## Note:

- If you do not have D-drive, then change the destination path variable on line 47 in main.py and replace "D:/InstaScraper/" to "C:/InstaScraper/"
- Enter valid credentials of your own instagram when prompted as selenium will scrape instagram using your account.
- Sit back and relax and the program will do everything and then automatically open the folder where the images are saved.
